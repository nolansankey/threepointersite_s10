        <h1>SBL Rules</h1><br>
        <h3><strong>The goal of the game </strong>is to finish the week with a larger earned balance than your opponent through placing bets on that week's sporting events</h3><br>
        <h3><strong>Gameplay Specifics:</strong></h3><br>
        <h4>During the regular season, each week on Monday at 12PM, 500 points become available in your granted balance to begin betting.</h4><br>
        <h4>Once a bet settles, the winnings will be moved to your earned balance.</h4><br>
        <h4>You can bet from your granted balance OR your earned balance, so even after you have won a bet, you can use those earnings on additional bets until the week’s end.</h4><br>
        <h4>On Friday morning at 8AM, an additional 500 points become available in your granted balance to be used for the  weekend</h4><br>
        <h4>Only your earned balance counts towards your final total, whereas your granted balance does not (i.e. you must bet each point at least once for it to count, you cannot just sit on the balance)</h4><br>
        <h4>Each week starts fresh as you face a new opponent and the balance does not roll over</h4><br>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>League Specifics:</strong></h3><br>
        <h4>The league is broken up into 2 divisions of 7.</h4><br>
        <h4>The regular season will be 7 weeks long with each player competing against every other player in their division as well as playing one "rivalry matchup" with a player in the opposing division.</h4><br>
        <h4>The top 4 teams in each division will enter a bracket-style playoff to decide the champion.</h4><br>
        <h4>During the playoffs, those who preformed better in the regular season will be offered a slightly larger granted balance as an advantage in their playoff matchup.</h4>
        <br>
        <h3><strong>Earning Money:</strong></h3><br>
        <h4>The primary game has a $25 buy-in with splits going to the top player(s) at the end of the playoffs</h4><br>
        <h4>Each week, you may optionally challenge your opponent to a “Throwdown” and make a side bet for that week’s competition. This is encouraged particularly for rivalry matchups with your close friends.</h4><br>
        <h4>On any given bet, you can chose to “make it count” where your points will be paid out as real money at a rate of 100pts = $1. I will put up money as the house and if you come out on top, then you can walk away with my cash. All deficits will be collected and the balance will be donated to a charity of the collective group’s choosing.</h4><br>
